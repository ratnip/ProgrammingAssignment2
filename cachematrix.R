## The functioncs will create a wrapper around the "matrix" class so it can cache its own inverse
## also, unlike the functions in the given template which lack comments and are probably completely baffling
## to a newcomer and teach a completely marginal thing which isn't really related to the basics of R 
## and are better suited as an obscure example of enforcing object-oriented programming principles
## ummm.. where was I.. oh yes, this functions will actually be commented properly. Not that it's necessary
## because noone is going to use them later on, including myself.


# a function which creates a matrix wrapper able to cache its own inverse, if calculated
# a logic for which will for some reason or other be outsourced to another function, yay!
makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  inv <- NULL
  set <- function(y) {    #a basic setter function if you know what that is
    x <<- y
    inv <<- NULL
  }
  get <- function() x     #a basic getter function. yipee
  setSolve <- function(p) inv <<- p   #a basic setter function for the inv variable
  getSolve <- function() inv            #a basic getter function for a bratwurst saus.. no, I mean for the inv variable
  list(set = set, get = get,
       setSolve = setSolve,
       getSolve = getSolve)           #I'm making a list, I'm checking it twice, gonna find out who's been naughty or nice

# the inverse of a matrix. Well, at least one of the above.
